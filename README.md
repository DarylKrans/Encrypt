# Encrypt

This is a test program that Encrypts / Decrypts any file with a user-customizable password.

BE CAREFUL!!!

This progrom does NOT store the password anywhere!!  The file is encrypted and a test phrase is encrypted with the password and attached to the file 
If the password you entered to decrypt the file is the same as the one you used to encrypt the file, the test phrase will match the program's phrase 
if decrypted correctly and the program will continue to decrypt the file and attach its original file extension.  

This program is a work-in-progress.  DO NOT test this file on anything you don't want to lose!
This program will attach the extension ".enc" to any file you encrypt (unless you choose otherwise)  If you open a file with the ".enc" extension,
if the password you supply is correct, the original file WILL be restored when you click 'Decrypt'.

This program now has the option to delete the source file after Encrypt/Decrypt

If you encrypt a file, delete the original and forget the password - Your data cannot be recovered (unless you are REALLY good at deciphering the encryption)

USE THIS PROGRAM AT YOUR OWN RISK!
